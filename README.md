# MAdetection
This project is to automatically detect Microaneurysms in Fundus Images.    
It is built in VisionX system http://www.via.cornell.edu/visionx/vxmore.html
It mainly implements algorithm described in Lazar, Istvan, and Andras Hajdu. "Retinal microaneurysm detection through local rotating cross-section profile analysis." IEEE Trans. Med. Imag., vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 400-407, Feb. 2013

Implemented stages:
1. Image Preprocessing (inversed green channel image, gaussian filtering), this part utilizes VisionX image processing command
2. Local Maximum Region Extraction
3. Cross-Sectional Scanning (implemented by Ling Zeng)
4. Peak Detection and Property Measurement on the Cross-Section Profile
5. Feature set building
6. Clasisfication uses VisionX command
7. Nonmaximum Suppression

With an input fundus image, it can output detected MA coordinates in a .csv file (one column y, one column x) and an image annotated with circles
